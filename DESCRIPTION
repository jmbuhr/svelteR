Description:
    Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces.
    Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
    This package lets you embedd these svelte apps right into your Rmardown documents.

# svelteR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of svelteR is to fluently embed svelte apps into Rmarkdown documents
producing html output.

## Installation

You can install svelteR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jmbuhr/svelteR")
```

Or when using the `renv` package for a local package library:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
renv::install("jmbuhr/svelteR")
```

## Features

- Embed the same app multiple times with different properties
- Embed multiple different apps
- Embed from a local folder or a public url
  (the second is work in process)

See this [example](articles/svelteR.html#demo-time-)
